/**
 * Starting over in the same place.
 *
 * A conversation's session id is derived, not allocated: the same chat (and,
 * after `/cd`, the same directory) resolves to the same id on every boot,
 * which is what lets a restarted process pick a conversation back up. That
 * leaves nothing to vary when someone wants a FRESH context without moving
 * anywhere — the reason `/new` did not exist.
 *
 * An epoch is that varying part: a small integer per (conversation ×
 * directory), stored beside the workspace and model maps and folded into the
 * id. Absent means zero, and zero derives exactly the id it always did, so no
 * stored conversation moves and nothing needs migrating.
 *
 * It is per directory rather than per conversation on purpose: `/cd` already
 * gives each directory its own thread, and resetting the thread you are in
 * should not silently discard the one you would return to.
 *
 * Nothing is deleted. A session log is written when an agent is created, so an
 * epoch nobody speaks into costs nothing at all, and the previous session
 * stays on disk where the host's own tools can still reach it — a chat command
 * should not be able to destroy a record.
 * @module dsh-lark-channel/epoch
