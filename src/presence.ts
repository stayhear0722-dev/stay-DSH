/**
 * Who the agent is, in the room it woke up in.
 *
 * An agent reached through chat arrives with a shell, a skill library, and no
 * idea where it is. Told nothing, it reads the situation the way it reads
 * every other one — as a task to work — so "say hello to the other bot"
 * becomes an investigation: read the messaging skill, shell out to a CLI, look
 * up the chat's members, and eventually answer through machinery that was
 * never needed, because a reply was always going to reach the room by itself.
 *
 * What it is missing is not instructions but a mental model: a colleague in a
 * group chat knows their own name, knows the reply IS the message, knows that
 * an @-mention hands someone the turn, and knows that saying nothing is a
 * normal way for a thread to end. Given that, the behaviour follows without
 * anyone enumerating it.
 *
 * So this section is one sentence. Every word competes with the deployment's
 * own prompt for attention, and the rest of the etiquette only matters in the
 * situation that needs it — which is why the baton line below rides the
 * message it applies to, rather than sitting here for every human turn.
